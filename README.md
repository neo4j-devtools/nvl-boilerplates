This repository contains boilerplates for creating a new project with NVL with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). There are two base projects for each, one using plain JavaScript and the other using [React](https://reactjs.org/). Copy the contents of the folder of the project you want to start with into a new folder and install the dependencies with your preferred package manager, e.g. using `yarn install`.
